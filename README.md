# AESvsChaos
comparing image encryption via AES and Chaos based encryption schemes

Usage:
Encrypt any image by running Main.java with mode = Cipher.ENCRYPT_MODE (follow the instructions there)
Decrypt the image using either the key and running Main.java with mode = Cipher.DECRYPT_MODE, or (if you encrypted with Chaos) use CPAdemo.java (and follow the instructions there)
